So, in order to develop speaking skills in public and address large gatherings, we started this initiative which also encourage them to read good books and develop their knowledge in socio political issues. We gather every month in a public park, everyone will share their opinion about the selected topic and then the moderator will give feedbacks and suggestions to speakers for improving their skill.
