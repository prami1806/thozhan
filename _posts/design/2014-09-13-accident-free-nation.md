## Traffic Awareness Campaign(TAC)
India ranks first in world and Tamil Nadu stands first in India and Chennai tops the list in death due to road accidents. To change this scenario and to make our roads safer by imbibing road sense among the public,we initiated our first Traffic Awareness Camp (TAC) in 2013 at the T.Nagar signal, Chennai, where our volunteers held awareness placards, voiced for reminding commuters to wear helmets, seatbelts and follow traffic rules. Day by day our awareness started to have an impact to the public where many from the common public has joined hands with us during the camps and continue to contribute to the awareness. Currently we have been doing TAC across major locations of Chennai, like T.Nagar, Velachery, Thiruvanmiyur, Kodambakkam, Anna Nagar, OMR etc summing up to 40 campaigns per month involving more than 450+ volunteers per month. 
## Seminars and Workshops
We regularly handle sessions, workshops in schools and colleges reaching over 1 lakh students and youngsters on road safety throughout the year.
## Knowledge Sharing
We constantly equip our warriors with knowledge through experts in all aspects which will be used to teach to public during our campaigns.
## World Day of Remembrance (WDR)
Every year we observe the World Day of Remembrance which is commemorated on the third Sunday of November to remember the many millions killed and injured on the worldâ€™s roads, together with their families, friends and many others who are also affected. We also use this opportunity to educate people about the need of road safety.
