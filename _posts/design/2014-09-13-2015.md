# 100 Signal TAC

A massive road safety awareness campaign was conducted in 100 traffic signals across Chennai and a few parts of Tamil Nadu at the same day and same time in August 2015.

# Safety Torch Run

On the account of Road safety week and 65th Republic day, we organized a 65 km relay rally for “Safety Torch Run” on 11 January 2015. People who follow road safety rules in their daily life carried a flame of light torch and went through critical spots in Chennai to spread road safety messages. Reiterating the necessities of wearing helmet and seat belt, educating them about safe road crossing by interacting with them about following rules etc. were some of the activities.<br>
