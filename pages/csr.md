<h2>Road Safety Council</h2><br/>
<p>Road Safety Council: Chennai Road Safety Council was formed with the intent to solve the traffic issues where the company resides. Making infrastructure and policy level changes are its goals. Presently, Thozhan heads this council. Cognizant, PayPal, Ford, Navis, Tech Mahindra, matrimony.com, Medusind and Grootan are in the council. We conduct sessions, campaigns and discussions to make the roads safer. Weâ€™ve made some infrastructure changes on M.G.R. Salai, OMR in Chennai, which is used by 80,000+ people for daily commute. After that, the accidents reduced drastically. We are working on implementing a model signal there, to make it a model Accident Free Zone road.</p>
